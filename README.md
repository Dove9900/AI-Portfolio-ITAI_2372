# AI-Portfolio-ITAI_2372
AI Applications Portfolio — Sasha Payne

Welcome to my AI Applications Portfolio for ITAI 2372.
This repository showcases selected projects completed during the course, demonstrating my growing skills in Python programming, Jupyter/Colab workflows, and applied AI concepts.

Portfolio Structure

This repository contains three organized project folders:

1. Module-3-Assignment

Contains my completed Module 3 Lab Exercise notebook.
Focus areas include:

Understanding basic ML workflow

Exploratory data analysis

Working with Python in Jupyter/Colab

Applying foundational AI concepts

File: Module_03_Lab_Exercise (2).ipynb

2. Jupyter-Exploration

This folder includes a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates:

Running and modifying cells

Executing Python code interactively

Practicing core Jupyter Notebook skills

Exploring variables, functions, and output formatting
